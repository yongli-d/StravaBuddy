StravaBuddy
===========

Promoting a healthy lifestyle using the Strava API 

1. Setting goals  
   - Competition between "buddies" or friends = challenge
   - Prize (treat them to a meal if BOTH achieve the goal - need sponsorships/partnerships)
   - Local events update (if there is a fun run near by...etc) 
   - Solo mode 
   - Track not just running but other physical activities 
   - Create a team challenge 
   - Suggested routes - best routes - recommended routes from people in area or by friends
2. Tracking activities 
   - Take a picture of the food (food diary) and comment (friends can thumbs up or down based on healthiness) 
   - Record on strava 


Extra (if more time or $):

1. Save battery 
   - automatically turn off other apps (SOUNDS LIKE A SEPARATE APP IDEA) 
   - Automatically save strava data before phone dies 
   - pause if no movement
